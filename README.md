# The Elm Architecture

The Elm Architecture is a simple pattern for infinitely nestable components.

This repo parallels [The Elm Architecture tutorial][arch], allowing you to follow along and compile things locally.

[arch]: https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/index.html


## Run The Examples

Start by [installing Elm](http://elm-lang.org/install) and [familiarizing yourself with the command line tools](http://elm-lang.org/get-started). Once that is done, run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/evancz/elm-architecture-tutorial.git
cd elm-architecture-tutorial
elm-reactor
```

This will download this repo and start a server that compiles Elm code for you.

Now go to [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) and start looking at the examples. When you edit an Elm file, just refresh the corresponding page in your browser and it will recompile.
